methods_long: " A two-part Bayesian hierarchical model was developed\
\ in which the first part estimates WNV cases from the prior year and then passes this information to\
\ the modelâ€™s second level to support target year predictions.  The model includes spatial and temporal\
\ effects as well as spatially varying coefficients (SVC) for climate factors to enable location-specific\
\ estimation of climatic influence."
