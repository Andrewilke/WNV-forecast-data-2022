methods: Since there is not any linear trend in the number of cases through years, linear models may not be a good option. For this challenge, we used a Poisson regression to fit our model.Since we are interested in changes during the years, we performed a fixed effect Poisson regression model. Our dependent variable is count (number of cases per county per year) and our independent variables are average temperature, average precipitation, mean cases of neighbors of each county for the previous year, and cumulative cases of each county for the past two years.
data_inputs: Temperature is the average temperature for each county per year (2000-2022, same years for the forecats) during each month (from ncdc.noaa.gov), Precipitation is the average precipitation for each county per year (2000-2022, same years for the forecats) during each month (from ncdc.noaa.gov), Mean cases of each county neighbors for the previous year, Cumulative cases of each county for the past two years.
